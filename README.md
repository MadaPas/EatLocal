### App Name - Eat Local

### Description
 > A website for food box subscription that sources products from local Swedish farmers.

### Problem statement
 > Farmers have to sell their produce for lower prices since only a few big companies buy the produce in bulk. The app will give regular consumers the possibility to buy directly from farmers and give more control over prices to the farmers. On the other hand, modern professionals lack the time to cook meals at home.

### Goals and Objectives
 > The app will connect farmers and busy professionals. And to facilitate this relationship the app will provide a weekly menu with recipes and a subscription service.

### Main functionality
 > Allows customers to subscribe to food boxes that will be delivered to their homes. They also have the possibility to cancel their subscriptions. Process payments. 

### Secondary functionality: 
 > Customer support through a pop-up chat. <br />
 > Login / Authorization and customer dashboard. <br />
 > Order history for each user <br />
 > Upcoming recipes displayed <br />
 > Map with sources of produce (farms)

### Tech Stack
 > MERN

### Third-party services
 > Making use of external API for recipes https://www.themealdb.com/api.php <br />
 > API for an online payment

### Time for development
 > 8 working days
